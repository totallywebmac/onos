The project onOS(online operating system) is just starting.
Drop bugs and other issues in the Issues tab.
Collab requests are good for the project!
For  any onOS questions please check the "Get Help" application found in the start menu (yet to be added so do not flood the Issues tab with "no help app").
If your questened topic is not in the "Get Help" app, then drop them in the Issues tab.
